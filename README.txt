This is a project we put together as partners in order to show talents regarding object oriented programming. Below is an 
explination of the game's mechanics.

When the game begins, the player will control a plate of spaghetti. The garfields' goal is to "eat" the spaghetti.
The player's goal is to escape/avoid the garfields. In order to score points, the plate of spaghetti must reach the
microwave, that is randomly spawned on the map one at a time. The plate of spaghetti also has its own health. Going to
a block of cheese will increase health by 1, while going to the can of sauce will increase health by 5. When a garfield
is in reach of the spaghetti, the spaghetti's health will continuously decrease by 1. Once out of heatlh, the spaghetti
is gone and the game is over, showing a screen with the final points. Bombs are also randomly placed throughout the map
and picking one up allows the player to click on a garfield to kill it. In order to kill the faster and smarter "angry"
garfield, the player must have at least 3 bombs. It requires 3 bombs in order to be killed. The regular garfield
requires one bomb to be killed. The confused garfield that goes around the map randomly cannot be killed, but it can
still eat the spaghetti, causing the game to end. To kill a garfield, the player must click on the garfield and the
garfield will die. On the top left corner, there is text showing how much health you have left as well as how many
bombs you currently possess. The top right corner will show you your points from reaching the microwaves.
